Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of engineering principal, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems 
  the importance of software engineering is that it enables software applications and systems to improve modern life
   it also provides the creation of reliable and innovative software solutions 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1 Birth of software (1968)
  first introduced at the nati software engineering conference in 1968 as a response to the software crisis when software development was plagued by cost overrun and missed deadline 
2 Rise of object -oriented programming (1980-1990)
  introduction and widespread adoption of object-oriented programming (OOP) and languages like C++ and java became popular 
3 The agile revolution (2001)
  this promoted flexibility , collaboration and development which marked a shift towards continuous integration and rapid feedback.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Requirements - this involves gathering and documenting the user's needs 
  Design - creating high level detailed designs of software 
  Implementation - this involves writing codes and building software according to design 
  Testing -  testing involves conducting tests to insure software meets the standards 
  Deployment - making software available for users 
  Maintenance - this includes supporting and updating the software 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is rigid to change an especially difficult once development starts.While agile is flexible and changes can be done at any time 
 In planning waterfall requires extensive planning upfront while agile requires continuous planning and adaptation 
           EXAMPLES 
   waterfall  can be used in construction and infrastructure  projects 
   Agile can be used in mobile app development 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer - responsible for writing, coding and making software solutions 
Quality assurance engineer - ensures software quality by designing and testing plans
Project manager - oversees the planning, execution and delivery of the projects 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDES provides developers with comprehensive set of tools for writing and testing code efficiently. An example is visual studio code(VS code)
VCS helps developers truck and manage changes to code, ensuring collaboration and prevent data loss. An example is GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements - good communication will help keep up with the changes 
Technical debt -  agile methodologies will best help with technical debt 



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   Unit testing 
tests individual components or functions of the software in isolation 
   Importance - catches bugs early in development, reducing debugging time
   Integration testing 
tests interactions between multiple components, modules or external systems 
   importance - detects communication issues between software components 
   system testing 
tests the entire application as a complete system 
    importance - confirms that the entire software works correctly as a whole 
Acceptance
conducted by end user to verify if the software meets business needs 
   importance - ensures that the software meets client expectations before trial deployment 

    

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective and optimized inputs to guide AI model's response 
     IMPORTANCE 
ENHANCING AI RESPONSE QUALITY 
this helps to produce clear,more precise  and contextual relevant answers 
IMPROVING EFFICIENCY well designed promt reduces the need for multiple interactions or clarification 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
